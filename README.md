How does the bot work? It's simple. The program creates many socket connections. These bots are unable to do anything but join. <br>
Their raid can be easily prevented by adding all repeated more than 2-3 times players' IPs to iptables blacklist. <br>
If the attacker has multiple ip's, it means he hosts the program on github or similar site. Just add all Azure ip's to the blacklist. <br>
A plugin that fights such bots is here: https://github.com/Kowkodivka/AntiBot
